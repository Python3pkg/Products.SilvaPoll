ToDo items
==========

- When a poll is not yet available, the message in the public view should 
  include the time.

- The poll display dates cannot be seen once a poll is published. These could
  be added to the info box in the status screeen. 

- When adding a Poll Service, one must choose whether to use cookies or not. 
  However, the service is not editable, which means a manager can't turn on 
  or off using cookies. This make it very clunky to test since you must delete
  and add another service, losing all the related data and getting errors on
  existing questions. 
  
Known bugs
----------

- If a poll is only available in the future, the message talks about the results:
  "The results of the poll will be available on this site from..."

- If an editor tries to "approve for future" in a container publish screen, 
  an AttributeError occurs:  
  'NoneType' object has no attribute 'set_question_start_datetime'
  Actually this isn't necessary because a poll can have a start time, and
  therefore the status screen doesn't have an "approve for future" button, but 
  the error shouldn't happen.
