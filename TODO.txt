ToDo items
==========

- The poll display dates cannot be seen once a poll is published. These could
  be added to the info box in the status screeen. 

- When adding a Poll Service, one must choose whether to use cookies or not. 
  However, the service is not editable, which means a manager can't turn on 
  or off using cookies. This make it very clunky to test since you must delete
  and add another service, losing all the related data and getting errors on
  existing questions.
