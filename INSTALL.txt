Prerequisities
--------------

SilvaPoll 0.3 requires a working Silva 1.5.x installation, with 
SilvaExternalSources installed properly. If you want to use the MySQL service
for storing poll data, a recent MySQL database and the zMySQLDA product should
be installed, too.

Basic installation instructions
-------------------------------

Unpack the SilvaPoll-0.3.tar.gz tarball in the Products directory of your
Zope instance. Restart Zope. Go to 'service_extensions' in your Silva root
(for Silva installation instructions, see Silva/INSTALL.txt), make sure that
the SilvaExternalSource package has been installed properly (if the box is
still gray, press the 'install' button) and press the 'install' button in
the SilvaPoll box. Press 'refresh all' in the top of the service if you're
updating other packages besides SilvaPoll.

Installing a service for data
-----------------------------

SilvaPoll comes with several different services that manage poll data: in the
current version there's one to add the data to the ZODB (not very optimal, 
since it creates a new transaction, and theferore database bloat, on every
vote) and one that uses a MySQL database. 

To install the ZODB version, go to the Silva root (ZMI) and choose 'Silva
Service Polls' from the 'add' select menu. This will take you to a screen where
an id and title can be entered for the service, leave the id as is, and
optionally fill in the title.

Installing the MySQL service requires similar steps, but also requires a 
zMySQLDA database adapter to be installed, with the id 'service_polls_mysqldb'.
If this service has been placed, add a 'Silva Service Polls MySQL' and also
make sure to not change the id (a ZODB and MySQL service can not co-exist).

Optional requirements
---------------------

Depending on other Silva products installed on your system, you might need
to adjust the 'addables' settings on the Silva root. Go to the properties tab
of the Silva root in the SMI, choose 'addables' and make sure the checkbox in
front of 'Silva Poll Question' is checked.
