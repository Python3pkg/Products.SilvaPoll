Prerequisities
--------------

SilvaPoll 0.3 requires a working Silva 1.6.x installation, with the extension
SilvaExternalSources installed. If you expect many polls resulting data and you
want to use MySQL for storing poll data, a recent MySQL database and the
zMySQLDA product should be installed, too.

Basic installation instructions
-------------------------------

- Unpack the SilvaPoll tarball in the Products directory of your Zope instance.

- Restart Zope. 

- Go to 'service_extensions' in your Silva root services (for Silva installation
  instructions, see Silva/INSTALL.txt), make sure that the SilvaExternalSource
  package has been activated properly (if the box is still gray, press the
  'activate' button)

- Press the 'activate' button in the SilvaPoll box. Or press 'refresh all' at 
  the top of the listing if you're updating other packages besides SilvaPoll.

- Install a poll service (see next section).

- Probably you'll have to turn on Silva Poll Question in the addables (see below).

Installing a service for data
-----------------------------

SilvaPoll comes with several different services that manage poll data: in the
current version there's one to add the data to the ZODB (not very optimal, since
it creates a new transaction on every vote) and one that uses a MySQL database.

To install the ZODB version, go to the Silva root (ZMI) and choose 'Silva
Service Polls' from the 'add' select menu. This will take you to a screen where
an id and title can be entered for the service, leave the id as is, and
optionally fill in the title.

Installing the MySQL service requires similar steps, but also requires a
zMySQLDA database adapter to be installed, with the id 'service_polls_mysqldb'.
Once this adapter has been placed, add a 'Silva Service Polls MySQL' and also
make sure to not change the id (a ZODB and MySQL service can not co-exist).

By default the option store cookie is turned on. This option limits voting by
setting a cookie on the users computer. If you don't want voting limits you
should uncheck this option.

Addable configuration
---------------------

Depending on other Silva products installed on your system, you might need to
adjust the 'addables' settings on the Silva root. Go to the properties tab of
the Silva root in the SMI, choose 'addables' and make sure the checkbox in front
of 'Silva Poll Question' is checked. You can also turn it on in the addables
properties of a lower level publication.
